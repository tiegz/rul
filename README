This is my RUL app
==================

RUL is an open-source XUL Runner framework. It helps you build a XUL Runner application by:

* auto-generating your application files
* providing utility tasks in rake to build and install your app

Instructions
============
1) git clone git://github.com/tiegz/rul.git rul
2) cd rul
3) rake app:new
4) rake app:install:mac (only works on Mac so far)
5) Open the Mac bundle from your /Applications directory to test

NOTE
====
This is totally experimental and the structure will probably change as I learn more about XULRunner 
and packaging XULRunner applications
